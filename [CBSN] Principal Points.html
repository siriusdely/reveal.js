<section id="between-ux-ui-sophisticated-simplicity-and-complexity-of-features" class="level1">
<h1>Between UX-UI Sophisticated Simplicity and Complexity of Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>In terms of complexity of features, this CBSN apps is more like Facebook, Path or Pinterest. It has features such as: User Management, Friendship Relations, even Complex Sructures of Objects (Events, Recipes, Dishs, Menus, etc).</li>
<li>Furthermore, Anggriawan once said to me that the benchmark is supposed to be Evernote, in terms of having Offline Editing Feature.</li>
<li>Obviously, the apps is not just easily can go through UI-UX definition by mimicking Clear app. We need to spent much effort on having our own signature of UX design. Expecially when we want to launch this app as a really full usable apps and get some meaningful number of tractions. Who is supposed to be responsible for this UX definition? ## (continued)</li>
<li>Moreover, when we look into Clear app, one of the main reason that they can do that awesome UI is because they have simple functional features. They don't even need backend support. They save the user content/information as a simple three level files, and doesn't even know the type of object that is inputted to the app. Far from a simple Facebook features to accommodate Subject-Predicate-Object status, such as: I am listening/watching/feeling a song/movie/feelings. Doesn't have user management (register, login) features. They integrate their app with iCloud. We don't even talk about images, friendships, assigning some todos. ## (continued)</li>
<li>We dont say that not everything from Clear can not be taken as inspiration. Of course something can be taken. But what we really want to say is, looks that we are too far on mimicking Clear, and not doing our homework.</li>
</ul>

<section id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-continuous-improvement-traction-and-making-money-with-trial-proven-business-model" class="level1">
<h1>Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Continuous Improvement, Traction, and Making Money with Trial &amp; Proven Business Model</h1>
<ul>
<li>In terms of having to launch a meaningful product with some normal constraints such as: Time, Cash, Market Information, People, Etc; we need to define our MVP.</li>
<li>Usually this MVP is only the core set of features.</li>
<li>Almost sure that the MVP do not yet need the cash-making ability. ## (continued)</li>
<li>But the most important thing for MVP is defining a stepping stone so that we already have something to say to prospective users, and later iterating from that point/step as we continuing to gather information/insights from the users.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="having-three-apps-built-at-the-same-time" class="level1">
<h1>Having Three Apps Built At The Same-Time</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is also a major challenge for us. Especially in defining the MVP.</li>
<li>Managing development of three apps interacting each other is quite difficult.</li>
<li>Lately, the feature or functional differences is quite blur.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="prototype-or-full-competitive-product-in-silicon-valley" class="level1">
<h1>Prototype or Full Competitive Product in Silicon Valley?</h1>
<ul>
<li>We need to know, and be open, about the expectation from our work, also from the app.</li>
<li>What we knew before is that we want to build a prototype of the app.</li>
<li>But later, it looks like that we need to built a market-proven app. This is also become a big challenge for us.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="analyst-user-interface-designer-user-experience-designer-and-product-designermanagerowner" class="level1">
<h1>Analyst, User Interface Designer, User Experience Designer, and Product Designer/Manager/Owner</h1>
<ul>
<li>Continuing the responsibility of UX designer (1.4), we (Suitmedia) have helped &amp; done analysis (analyst), UI design (graphical designer), User Experience (all the team).</li>
<li>Actually for UX design, we expected it from you and your team in US. Because we believed that you have knowledge and experience on that.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the role is supposed to be the Product Designer/Manager/Owner of this app.</li>
<li>We were once told that we will have some persons from US that will review our code implementation, but there is not until now. This generate some questions on our part.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="between-having-us-and-indonesian-development-consultant-team" class="level1">
<h1>Between Having US and Indonesian Development Consultant Team</h1>
<ul>
<li>Having us to do this development and consultancy work instead of many more experienced team on the US, Europe or others, the main reason is in terms of having the lower cost one.</li>
<li>Actually, our cost is much lower. Relatively, it is only 20% of the others.</li>
<li>However, we cannot go further in lowering our development fee. Fajrin already said that our man-day rate that we apply to this project already lower that our standard on Indonesian clients.</li>
<li>So we are here, having our most good intentions, to come to your satisfaction, without sacrificing our needs.</li>
